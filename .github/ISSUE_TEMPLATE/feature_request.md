## Before requesting a feature
We're in the process to transition from completely closed to completely open source. Before taking this important step, we're using this project to show our intent by releasing hundreds of scripts for WHMCS 100% free.

Recently we started re-routing some presales from [our site](https://katamaze.com/) here on Github. Basically we're willing to code solutions for free. The only requirement is that we're open for **small and medium-sized projects** that are not in contrast with [what we are selling](https://katamaze.com/whmcs).

Let's start!

## Describe the solution you'd like
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen in your WHMCS.
